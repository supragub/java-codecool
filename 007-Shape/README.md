# java-codecool / 007-Shape

Task #1

Shapes are terms in geometry which have area and perimeter. Circles, rectangles, triangles are all shapes.

Write a program which receives an array of any kind of shapes (Shape[]) and summarizes their area and returns with the calculated value.

IMPORTANT !!! There is no point to create a Shape without specifying if it is a circle, a rectangle or a triangle, so be careful !



Task #2

There is a country where people pay with a special money. Different coins have different shapes (triangle, circle and rectangle) and different sizes. (you can use your solution from previous task)
Coins have different values: triangle = 1, circle = 2, rectangle = 5, but their real value depends on their size and is calculated like value * area - perimeter.
Your task is to create classes which represent these coins the best way.

Create an other class which should contain a method (beside main method) which receives an array of coins (Coin[]) and returns with the total real amount.
